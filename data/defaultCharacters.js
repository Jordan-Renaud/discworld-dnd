        The Librarian is known for his violent reaction whenever he hears anyone
        refer to him as a &quot;monkey&quot; (orang-utans are apes). He speaks
        an elaborate language whose vocabulary consists of the single word Ook
        (and its antonym &quot;eek&quot; - where &quot;ook&quot; means yes,
        &quot;eek&quot; tends to mean no). Nonetheless, most people seem to be
        able to understand him.
